# ik-acceleration
This is the FPGA acceleration for inverse kinematics algorithm.

The idea of this work comes from our paper ["Dadu: Accelerating Inverse Kinematics for high-DOF robots"](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8060343/), in *2017 54th ACM/EDAC/IEEE Design Automation Conference (DAC)*.

We improve the algorithm and use HLS technology to accelerate IK on FPGA. The detail can be seen at ["A Study of Inverse Kinematics Algorithm and Its
System Architecture Implementation"](https://github.com/CICS-ICT/ik-acceleration/blob/master/A_Study_of_Inverse_Kinematics_Algorithm_and_Its_System_Architecture_Implementation.pdf)
