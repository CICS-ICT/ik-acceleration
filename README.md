# ik-acceleration
This is the FPGA acceleration for inverse kinematics algorithm.

The idea of this work comes from ["Dadu: Accelerating Inverse Kinematics for high-DOF robots"](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8060343/), in *2017 54th ACM/EDAC/IEEE Design Automation Conference (DAC)*.

We improve the algorithm and use HLS technology to accelerate IK on FPGA.
